    <para>
        The goal of Solder's Servlet integration features is to provide portable enhancements to the Servlet API. Features include
        producers for implicit Servlet objects and HTTP request state, propagating Servlet events to the CDI event bus,
        forwarding uncaught exceptions to Solder's exception handling chain and binding the <literal>BeanManager</literal> to a 
        Servlet context attribute for convenient access.
