            <para>
               An exception chain is made up of many different exceptions or causes until the root exception is found
               at the bottom of the chain. When all of the causes are removed or looked at this forms the causing
               container. The container may be traversed either ascending (root cause first) or descending (outer
               most first).

            <para>
               A CDI enabled Bean which contains handler methods.

         <glossdef>
           <para>
               A method within a handler bean which is marked as a handler using the <literal>@Handler</literal>s on an argument,
               which must be an instance of <literal>CaughtException</literal>. Handler methods typically are public with a void return.
               Other parameters of the method will be treated as injection points and will be resolved
               via CDI and injected upon invocation.
