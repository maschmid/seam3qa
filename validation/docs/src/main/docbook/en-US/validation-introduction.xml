  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The Seam Validation module aims at integrating <ulink
  url="http://validator.hibernate.org/">Hibernate Validator</ulink>, the
  reference implementation for the Bean Validation API (<ulink
  url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303">JSR 303</ulink>), with CDI (<ulink
  url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">JSR 299</ulink>).</para>

  <para>This integration falls into two main areas:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Enhanced dependency injection services for validators, validator
      factories and constraint validators</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Automatic validation of method parameters and return values based
      on Hibernate Validator's method validation feature</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <note>
    <para>The Seam Validation module is based on version 4.2 or later of
    Hibernate Validator. As of March 2011 Hibernate Validator 4.2 is still in
    the works and no final release exists yet.</para>

    <para>This means that - though unlikely - also changes to the API of the
    Seam Validation module might become necessary.</para>

    <para>The Seam Validation module is therefore released as a technology
    preview with the Seam 3 release train, with a final version following
    soon. Nevertheless you should give it a try already today and see what the
    Seam Validation module and especially the automatic method validation
    feature can do for you. Please refer to the <ulink
    url="http://seamframework.org/Seam3/ValidationModule">module home
    page</ulink> for any news on Seam Validation.</para>
